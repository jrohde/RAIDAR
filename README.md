# RAIDAR

RAIDAR is a direct creator to consumer music licensing solution that empowers Berklee students to begin building sustainable careers on their own terms via:

* Monetizing their musical works while retaining ownership of their songs.
* Learning about intellectual property through active engagement.
* Determining the value of their work by placing it in a free market.
* Connecting with other creators that want to license their music for audiovisual works such as film, video games, and VR.

Open Music Initiative's values and open source protocols guide RAIDAR. [Open Music](https://open-music.org/) is a non-profit initiative of Berklee and MIT Connection Science founded to

* Advance interoperability for musical rights owner identification and remuneration;
* Educate creators about intellectual property rights; and
* Explore and promote innovation across the music industry ecosystem.

RAIDAR is not a basic music library. All payments flow entirely to the Berklee student creators. All music on RAIDAR has been composed by students and alumni of Berklee, the preeminent institution of contemporary music. Open Music's membership grants access to RAIDAR based upon adherence to the [principles](https://app.hellosign.com/s/564b0042) of the Open Music Initiative, which includes equity, sustainability, creativity, and interoperability, and adherence to the technical criteria of Open Music's [protocols and API](https://open-music.org/our-open-protocols).
